## Platform Components

**Challenge Server -** The central orchestration system managing challenge lifecycles, submission tracking, batch distribution to validators, score aggregation, and S3 storage operations.

**Chip Design Team -** Creates hardware challenges representing state-of-the-art circuit design problems with comprehensive test suites containing millions of instructions.

**EDA Server -** A FastAPI application built around open-source EDA tools (OpenLane, Verilator) that analyzes design functionality, area, timing, and power consumption.
