title: "Core Metrics: PPA + Functionality (PPA+F)"
---

The competitive element is driven by rewarding miners based on four critical metrics, which extend the traditional industry standard of PPA (Power, Performance, Area):

1. **Functionality (F):** The design must function correctly according to the required ISA specification.
2. **Performance (P):** Highest clock speed or operations-per-second.
3. **Power (P):** Minimum power consumption.
4. **Area (A):** Smallest physical silicon footprint.

Miners with the **best overall design** across these four metrics are rewarded. While full functional correctness is the ultimate objective, ChipForge strategically rewards miners based on outstanding work in PPA metrics, even if functionality is not 100% complete at the start. This incentivizes **pioneering hardware optimization** and rapid iterative feedback.
