ChipForge reimagines semiconductor design as a decentralized, competitive marketplace. Our architecture comprises three fundamental components:

Challenge Server: The orchestration layer that manages design challenges, distributes specifications, collects submissions, and coordinates validation. Built on enterprise-grade infrastructure with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and AWS S3, the Challenge Server ensures reliable, scalable operation while maintaining cryptographic security for all transactions.

Miner Network: A global pool of hardware designers, ranging from individual engineers to AI-powered design automation systems. Miners compete to create optimal solutions for each challenge, leveraging both human creativity and machine intelligence. The competitive dynamic ensures continuous innovation while the cryptocurrency incentives attract top talent globally.

Validator Ecosystem: Independent nodes running standardized EDA tool chains to evaluate designs objectively. Validators execute functional verification, synthesis, and physical implementation to generate comprehensive PPA metrics. This distributed validation ensures no single entity can manipulate results while maintaining reproducibility and transparency.
