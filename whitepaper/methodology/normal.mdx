title: 'Score Normalization'
---

All individual metric scores and the final **Overall Score** ($O_c$) are normalized to the **0–1 range**, where a score of 1 represents 100% of the ideal metric performance.

| Metric        | Score Abbreviation | Description                                                     |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Functionality | $F_c$              | Correct execution of the instruction set.                       |
| Performance   | $P_c$              | Instructions executed per second (throughput).                  |
| Area          | $Area$             | Efficiency of silicon utilization (smaller is better).          |
| Power         | N/A (TBD)          | Power consumption in milliwatts.                                |
