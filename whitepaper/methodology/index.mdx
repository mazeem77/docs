The Chipforge Platform evaluates hardware designs using a comprehensive, weighted scoring function. The scoring methodology is **dynamic**, with both the weight distribution for the primary metrics and a minimum functionality threshold defined by the Chip Design Team in a challenge-specific `weights.json` configuration file. This allows the platform to emphasize specific design qualities, such as performance or silicon efficiency, based on the requirements of the current challenge.
