title: 'Dynamic Scoring Formula'
---

The individual weights ($W_{Func}$, $W_{Delay}$, $W_{Area}$) and the minimum Functionality Threshold ($Threshold_{Func}$) are loaded from the `weights.json` file.

- **Constraint:** The submission must achieve a minimum Functionality Score ($F_c$) greater than or equal to the dynamic $Threshold_{Func}$ to receive a non-zero overall score.

$$
\text{IF } F_c \ge Threshold_{Func} :
$$

$$
O_c = \frac{(W_{Func} \cdot F_c) + (W_{Area} \cdot Area) + (W_{Perf} \cdot P_c)}{Total\_W}
$$

$$
\text{IF } F_c < Threshold_{Func} :
$$

$$
O_c = 0
$$

*Note:* The power metric is not currently evaluated, as it will be integrated for future challenges, such as the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) development specifically for edge AI applications, where power is a critical concern.
