title: "The Edge Computing Paradox"
---

As AI workloads increasingly move to the edge, the mismatch between hardware requirements and available solutions becomes acute. Edge devices require:

- **Ultra-Low Latency:** Real-time inference with sub-10ms response times.
- **Power Efficiency:** Operation within strict thermal and battery constraints.
- **Cost Optimization:** Bill-of-materials costs compatible with consumer and industrial products.
- **Privacy Preservation:** On-device processing without cloud dependencies, with **on-device security** (authentication, secure communication) as well.

Current solutions fail to address these requirements holistically. General-purpose processors lack the efficiency for complex AI workloads, while existing AI accelerators are optimized for cloud deployments with unlimited power budgets. The result is a **massive unserved market for edge-optimized silicon**.
