title: "The Monopolization of Innovation"
---

The semiconductor industry exhibits extreme concentration across multiple dimensions:

Design Intellectual Property: Five companies control over 80% of critical IP blocks used in modern chip designs. This concentration creates artificial scarcity and inflates licensing costs, with some IP blocks costing millions of dollars to license for a single project.

EDA Tools: Three corporations dominate the EDA tool market, with annual licenses exceeding \$1 million for comprehensive toolchains. This creates an insurmountable barrier to entry for independent designers and small teams.

Fabrication Access: Advanced node fabrication (7nm and below) is concentrated in just three companies globally, with minimum order quantities often exceeding \$10 million.

Talent Concentration: The top 20 semiconductor companies employ the vast majority of experienced chip designers, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of centralization.
