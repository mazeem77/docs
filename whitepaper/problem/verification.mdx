title: "The Verification Bottleneck"
---

Traditional chip design follows a waterfall model where verification consumes **60-70% of development time and resources**. A single design iteration can take months, with each bug discovered late in the process potentially adding weeks to the schedule. This sequential approach:

- Limits design space exploration to conservative, incremental improvements.
- Prevents rapid iteration based on real-world feedback.
- Creates enormous financial risk, as errors discovered post-fabrication can cost millions to rectify.

**ChipForge Solution:** To fundamentally disrupt this bottleneck, we are developing a decentralized mechanism where miners are incentivized to **prove a design wrong by finding a bug**, analogous to how miners compete in a blockchain's Proof-of-Work system. This feature, which will function as a specialized subnet for verification challenges, is currently in development and will allow for parallel, competitive verification using open-source EDA tools. Our current focus remains on democratizing the initial design phase.
