Following core finalization, development transitions to the specialized Neural Processing Unit (NPU). This phase utilizes the **Google Coral NPU architecture as a verified baseline**. The core activity is the technical benchmarking and optimization of the architecture to achieve superior **PPA (Power, Performance, Area) metrics**. A primary technical focus involves custom optimization of the NPU's Matrix Execution Unit to enhance performance for deep learning workloads, ensuring alignment with emerging RISC-V matrix extension standards.
