## **10.1 Total Addressable Market**

The semiconductor design tools and IP market represents a \$50+ billion annual opportunity growing at 12% CAGR. Within this:

- • Edge AI Chips: \$15 billion by 2027
- • Custom ASICs: \$8 billion current market
- • Design Services: \$12 billion annually

ChipForge targets the intersection of these markets, focusing on customers requiring custom silicon but lacking resources for traditional development approaches.

## **10.2 Cost Structure Analysis**

Traditional chip development costs:

- • Design Team: \$5-10 million annually
- • EDA Tools: \$1-2 million annually
- • Prototype Fabrication: \$2-5 million
- • Total Project Cost: \$15-30 million

ChipForge alternative:

- • Challenge Rewards: \$50,000-500,000
- • Validation Costs: \$10,000-50,000
- • Integration Effort: \$100,000-500,000
- • Total Project Cost: \$200,000-1 million

This 10-30x cost reduction democratizes access to custom silicon, enabling new applications and business models previously impossible.

## **10.3 Network Effects and Value Creation**

ChipForge exhibits strong network effects:

Value = k × (Miners × Validators × Challenges)^α\
\
Where:

k = Utility constant

α \> 1 (super-linear growth)

As the network grows:

- • More miners → Better designs → More challenges
- • More validators → Faster evaluation → Higher throughput
- • More challenges → Greater rewards → More participation
