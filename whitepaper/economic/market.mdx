The semiconductor design tools and IP market represents a \$50+ billion annual opportunity growing at 12% CAGR. Within this:

- • Edge AI Chips: \$15 billion by 2027
- • Custom ASICs: \$8 billion current market
- • Design Services: \$12 billion annually

ChipForge targets the intersection of these markets, focusing on customers requiring custom silicon but lacking resources for traditional development approaches.
