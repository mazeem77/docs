title: 'Network Effects and Value Creation'
---
ChipForge exhibits strong network effects:

Value = k × (Miners × Validators × Challenges)^α\
\
Where:

k = Utility constant

α \> 1 (super-linear growth)

As the network grows:

- • More miners → Better designs → More challenges
- • More validators → Faster evaluation → Higher throughput
- • More challenges → Greater rewards → More participation
