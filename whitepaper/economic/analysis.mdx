Traditional chip development costs:

- • Design Team: \$5-10 million annually
- • EDA Tools: \$1-2 million annually
- • Prototype Fabrication: \$2-5 million
- • Total Project Cost: \$15-30 million

ChipForge alternative:

- • Challenge Rewards: \$50,000-500,000
- • Validation Costs: \$10,000-50,000
- • Integration Effort: \$100,000-500,000
- • Total Project Cost: \$200,000-1 million

This 10-30x cost reduction democratizes access to custom silicon, enabling new applications and business models previously impossible.
