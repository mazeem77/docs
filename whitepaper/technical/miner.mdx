title: 'Miner Workflow'
---

Miners interact with the ChipForge ecosystem through a well-defined workflow:

1. Discovery Phase: Query active challenges and download specifications
2. Design Phase: Develop RTL implementations meeting challenge requirements
3. Validation Phase: Local testing using provided testbenches
4. Submission Phase: Upload designs with cryptographic signatures
5. Evaluation Phase: Monitor validation progress and scores
6. Reward Phase: Receive TAO tokens for winning designs

The platform supports both human designers using traditional EDA tools and AI-powered systems generating RTL through large language models. This hybrid approach leverages human creativity for architectural innovations while utilizing AI for optimization and parameter tuning.
