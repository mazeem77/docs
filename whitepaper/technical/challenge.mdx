title: 'Challenge Server Architecture'
---

The Challenge Server implements a sophisticated orchestration system managing the complete lifecycle of design challenges:

API Layer: RESTful endpoints implemented in FastAPI providing separate interfaces for miners and validators. Authentication via Ed25519 signatures ensures cryptographic security while rate limiting prevents abuse.

Database Layer: PostgreSQL database managing challenge metadata and specifications, miner submissions and validation records, cryptographic nonces for replay prevention, and API keys for validator authentication.

Storage Layer: AWS S3 integration providing hierarchical organization of design files, time-limited pre-signed URLs for secure access, complete audit trails of all operations, and multi-region replication for reliability.

Processing Layer: Asynchronous task processing via Celery combined with Redis enabling batch formation for validator distribution, score aggregation from multiple validators, automated challenge lifecycle management, and real-time leaderboard updates.
