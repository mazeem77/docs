This competitive structure guarantees that competition translates directly into collective progress:

- **Convergence to Optimality:** The strict PPA+F scoring mechanism, paired with the mandatory improvement rule, guarantees that design submissions are continuously driven toward **Pareto-optimal solutions**—the ideal balance of performance, area, and power for the specified function.
- **Integrity Enforcement:** Validator integrity is protected through the Bittensor network's inherent **Slashing Mechanisms** and a system of **Reputation and Stake**, which rewards accurate scoring and financially penalizes non-compliance. Sybil resistance is maintained through the significant computational cost required to execute the required EDA toolchains for functional verification.
