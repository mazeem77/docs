description: 'The Continuous Optimization Loop (Winner-Takes-All Emissions)'
---

The platform utilizes a **Winner-Takes-All** reward structure that is applied continuously, ensuring constant effort and iterative improvement within the network:

- **Real-Time Emission:** Unlike traditional contests, rewards (TAO emissions) are not paid at a single endpoint. Instead, emissions are **granted in real-time** to the Miner whose design currently holds the highest verified PPA+F score above the challenge's threshold.
- **Instantaneous Competition:** If a second Miner submits an objectively better design (a higher PPA+F score), the emission stream **immediately switches** to that new winning Miner. This mechanism financially incentivizes a relentless pursuit of optimization, as the reward stream follows the globally best design at all times.
- **Mandatory Improvement Rule:** To ensure a stable but continuously advancing design, a Miner who wins the emission is guaranteed that reward for a minimum of 48 hours, provided their score remains the highest. **However, after that 48-hour period, the current winning Miner must submit an even higher-scoring solution than their previous best to remain eligible for the emission stream.** This rule explicitly enforces constant improvement and discourages complacency, continually pushing the performance frontier of the verified IP.
