## 1. Functionality Score ($F_c$)

This metric measures the design's functional correctness.

- **Test Generation & Golden Reference:** The Chip Design Team creates comprehensive test suites and runs them on the official **RISC-V ISA Simulator (SPIKE)** to generate the "golden output."
- **Design-Under-Test (DUT) Execution:** The same test cases are executed on the miner's design using the EDA Server's **Verilator** tool for simulation.
- **Scoring:** The $F_c$ score is determined by comparing the DUT’s results against SPIKE's golden outputs.

$$
F_c = \frac{N_{correct}}{N_{total}}
$$

Where $N_{correct}$ is the number of instructions that matched the golden result, and $N_{total}$ is the total number of executed instructions.\
$F_c$ is a value between 0 and 1.

## 2. Performance Score ($P_c$)

Performance is quantified as **Instructions Per Second (IPS)**, representing the processing throughput.

- **IPC & Max Clock Speed ():** The processor's **Instructions Per Cycle (IPC)** is measured using performance tests. The processor's maximum clock speed, referred to as $F_{max}$ (Max Frequency), is determined through timing analysis using **OpenLane**.
- **Performance (IPS):** The throughput is calculated as:

$$
IPS = IPC \times F_{max}
$$

- **Normalization:** This raw IPS value is then normalized against a defined benchmark IPS to yield the _0–1_ $P_c$ score (a higher IPS results in a score closer to 1).
