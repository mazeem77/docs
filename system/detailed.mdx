**1.     Functionality Score ( )**

 

This metric measures the design's functional correctness.

·       **Test Generation & Golden Reference:** The Chip Design Team creates comprehensive test suites and runs them on the official **RISC-V ISA Simulator (SPIKE)** to generate the "golden output."

·       **Design-Under-Test (DUT) Execution:** The same test cases are executed on the miner's design using the EDA Server's **Verilator** tool for simulation.

·       **Scoring:** The  score is determined by comparing the DUT’s results against SPIKE's golden outputs.

Where  is the number of instructions that matched the golden result, and  is the total number of executed instructions.  is a value between 0 and 1.

**2.     Performance Score ( )**

 

Performance is quantified as **Instructions Per Second (IPS)**, representing the processing throughput.

·       **IPC & Max Clock Speed ( ):** The processor's **Instructions Per Cycle (IPC)** is measured using performance tests. The processor's maximum clock speed, referred to as  (Max Frequency), is determined through timing analysis using **OpenLane**.

·       Performance (IPS): The throughput is calculated as:

·       **Normalization:** This raw IPS value is then normalized against a defined benchmark IPS to yield the 0-1  score (a higher IPS results in a score closer to 1).

 

 

**3.     Area Score ( )**

 

The  score measures the silicon efficiency of the design.

·       **Synthesis & Measurement:** The design is synthesized using **OpenLane (Yosys)** targeting the sky130nm PDK, and the total silicon area is extracted.

·       **Normalization:** The  score is **inversely proportional** to the measured area (a smaller area yields a score closer to 1). This score is normalized against a target area defined by the challenge.

**4.     Power Consumption Score (TBD)**

 

This metric is currently under development. Once integrated, the  will be inversely proportional to the measured power consumption, normalized against a target power consumption.
