title: "Score Normalization"
---

All individual metric scores and the final **Overall Score ( )** are normalized to the **0-1 range**, where a score of 1 represents 100% of the ideal metric performance.

| **Metric**        | **Score Abbreviation** | **Description**                                        |
| :---------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functionality** |                        | Correct execution of the instruction set.              |
| **Performance**   |                        | Instructions executed per second (throughput).         |
| **Area**          |                        | Efficiency of silicon utilization (smaller is better). |
| **Power**         | N/A (TBD)              | Power consumption in milliwatts.                       |
