title: "Dynamic Scoring Formula"
---

The individual weights ($W_{Func}$, $W_{Delay}$, $W_{Area}$) and the minimum Functionality Threshold ($Threshold_{Func}$) are loaded from the `weights.json` file.

- **Constraint:** The submission must achieve a minimum Functionality Score ($F_c$) greater than or equal to the dynamic $Threshold_{Func}$ to receive a non-zero overall score.

$$
\text{IF } F_c \ge Threshold_{Func} :
$$

$$
O_c = \frac{(W_{Func} \cdot F_c) + (W_{Area} \cdot Area) + (W_{Perf} \cdot P_c)}{Total\_W}
$$

$$
\text{IF } F_c < Threshold_{Func} :
$$

$$
O_c = 0
$$

<Note>
  The power metric is not currently evaluated, as it will be integrated for future challenges, such as the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) development, where power is a critical concern.
