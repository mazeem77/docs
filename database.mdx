The system uses PostgreSQL with five main tables:

**challenges** - Challenge metadata, lifecycle state, cryptographic nonces, validator requirements, and submission limits

**miner_submissions** - Submission metadata, file references, multi-bucket storage (miner/ validator/ archive), validation counts, and status tracking

**validation_records** - Individual validator evaluations, detailed score breakdown, evaluation notes, and validator-specific file paths

**submission_nonces** - Cryptographic nonce management with expiration tracking and rate limiting

**validator_api_keys** - API key lifecycle, usage tracking, audit trails, and activation/revocation history
